# code put in here works for 10ag with relative information. 
# as discussed with AR and VK,all the robots are getting perfect information about where to go.
# next version will involve only some robots getting their goal information. Also one version will 
# max out number of agents. 

# dynamic graph also works but we found that dynamic graph takes longer to train as compared to static graph.
